We all wonder why Uber was valued at $80bn+ (IPO Stage) or Oyo being valued at $10bn, and Zomato coming in at $4bn+. What is common for these investments is overvaluation – a critique of the underlying business models and consequently ridicule for the investors. Another common factor for Uber and Oyo, and potentially Zomato as we move forward is SoftBank – But that’s a topic for another day.

This article does not aim to provide a perspective on whether those numbers are justifiable, but aims to provide an oversimplified account of overvaluation of startups from a purely technical perspective. It is derived from the pathbreaking work of Will Gornall (Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia) and Ilya A. Strebulaev (Graduate School of Business, Stanford University & National Bureau of Economic Research). Before I proceed, I wish to thank the authors for this work.

Law of One Price

The law of one price is an economics concept which states that any two assets providing identical utility shall have similar prices. Conversely, if one asset is relatively expensive, we shall sell it and buy the cheaper asset provided two assets have identical utility and engage in what is known as arbitrage – the process of earning risk free profit.

To provide an example, imagine you own two banana trees. Each tree gives out exactly 10 bananas at the end of every month. These bananas have similar taste, similar length, similar girth and every other considerable characteristic is absolutely identical. Now, one fine day, you need to cut the tree and build a seesaw. Regardless of which tree you cut, you shall get a similar space and build an equally attractive seesaw. Would you as the owner of the two banana trees prefer to cut one over the other? Or would you be equally comfortable with cutting either one of them? Your answer will certainly be the latter.

Expand the same concept to any two financial instruments. If two bonds, or two shares of two different companies that are identical in all aspects except name provide you with similar payouts – you shall value them similarly. That is what the law of one price means.

Note: It is important that the reader understand the concept before proceeding any further, as it forms the basis of this article.

Valuation of Startups: From Round A to Round F

Imagine you are the founder of a startup, you have 40,000 shares of your company. A Venture Capital fund approaches you and asks for 10,000 new shares – over and above the 40,000 shares of your company – and offers you $10,000 for it. In a typical valuation, that would mean your per share price is $10,000/10,000 – $1 per share. With total share capital base of your company at 40,000 (old) + 10,000 (new) = 50,000 (combined), and a value of $1 per share based on the financing – we arrive at a valuation of $50,000. This valuation of $50,000 is called a post-money valuation – meaning valuation after the money has been invested. Also, if we remove from this $50,000 the $10,000 we have received now, we have $40,000 – value of old shares at current price – this is known as pre-money valuation.

Now, continue adding 10,000 shares for each new round, the shares must be valued at multiple of 10 i.e. – $10 per share for Series B, $100 per share for Series C, $1,000 per share for series D, $10,000 per share for Series E and finally, $100,000 per share for Series F. At the end of this process, your startup will have a post-money valuation of $100,000 multiplied by 100,000 total shares – implying a total valuation of $10bn.

Our implicit assumption while arriving at the final valuation is that all shares issued in the process are identical – hence the law of one price must apply. Unfortunately, all VC investments are not identical and are accompanied by a host of conditions.

Venture Capital Investments: The Typical Investment

As most of you may know, common shareholders come last on the food chain i.e. it is only after paying all expenses of the firm, the interest on borrowings and finally the preference dividend, that the common shareholder gets his or her return. Additionally, depending on jurisdiction, common shareholders may have to bear certain responsibilities if their shareholding crosses a threshold. So, venture capital firms like to opt for what is called a convertible preference share. These shares are preference shares, which are convertible to equity shares, based on certain pre-conditions. This allows venture firms to gain on the upside of a startup firm but limit exposure on the downside.

For instance – Assume that a firm raised $5mn at a pre-money valuation of $45mn. Now, the firm may either shut down, or do fair, or kill it in the marketplace. In the case of outcome 1, we typically look at severe cash crunch and it hardly matters whether you had a preference share or a common share. In the case of outcome 3, the pay-off is huge, such that all investors could not care whether they had a preference share or common share. Where this generally matters is outcome 2, when the firm did okay.

For our case, assume that the firm is eventually acquired by a firm for $50mn. Since this is the same as the post-money valuation, it again wouldn’t matter whether you had held preference shares or common shares. You would receive only your $5mn initial investment back. Now assume the firm is acquired for $60mn. In this case you exercise your option to convert you preference shares into equity shares and receive 10% of the payout i.e. $6mn. A nice 20% profit on your investment. Now assume the firm is acquired for $40mn. In this case, as a preference shareholder you get your $5mn back, whereas if you converted to equity shares – your payout would be $4mn. Hence, a preference shareholder gets additional financial value only when the convertibility of the shares allows such a payout. The investor managed to save 20% of the initial investment in the case of the acquisition.

The Law of One Price: Revisited

Our preliminary examination reveals that even at a base level of investment, the two shares i.e. the common shares and preference shares issued by companies are not identical. With specific circumstance giving rise to differential cash flow to common and preferred shareholders, we must contend that the Law of One Price does not operate. Even at a base level of convertible preference shares, there is with certainty, at least some overvaluation of startups – since the preferred shareholders get additional rights.

Borrowing from our first example in this article – With 40,000 common shares, and 60,000 preference shares, the post-money valuation of $10bn does not hold, since each share cannot be valued at the $100,000 price.

Why do venture capitalists then choose to continue using this method to value their portfolio? Many investors, excepting the likes of the famous Andreseen Horowitx, continue to use this valuation method.

Epilogue

In the next article to this 2 part series, I will attempt to evaluate and explain further complexities in investment structures and how the Law of One Price falls severely in these cases, and the case of why venture investors continue to use this method.
