One of the first hires for McDonald’s, Mr. Harry J Sonneborn told Mr. Ray Kroc – “You’re not in the burger business, you’re in the real estate business.”

That one line changed the way McDonald’s did business and turned a hitherto failing business into the world’s largest burger chain.

Perhaps, it’s time that the clothing industry changed too. Michelin did it with tyres and it made its way into the HBS Case files. Time to finally get some sales for Peter England?



Michael Porter, the strategy guru talked about Marketing Myopia – referencing the inability of firms to have a holistic view of their offering. The analysis starts with customer’s end use of the product i.e. what value does it provide to the consumer.

For clothing, the perceived value is a cover for the body. But as we go up the income pyramid, clothing starts to be value more as a fashion use product – the body cover having been deposited at the base as an order qualifier, fashion value serving as the order winner.

Brands however continue to focus on selling that fashion. As a corporate employee buying 20 shirts for INR 3k per shirt – you spend INR 60k on clothes that become less valuable more due to fashion obsolescence than wear and tear. What if you had to instead pay INR 50k for an annual subscription that would deliver clothes for a week to your home? – ensuring that you don’t need to put in time to purchase, store and maintain clothes. Additionally, this subscription would ensure that you keep getting acces to fresh fashion and never have to worry about that again.

It could be run with 180 instead of 20 shirts, being circulated and maintained within a group of 9 men with similar body shapes and clothing preferences. That sure must sound difficult, but imagine in an office locale like Gurugram or Noida – thousands of employees flock to the office. The larger the population, the easier it must be to access people with similar preferences.

Still doesn’t sound well enough? What if you augmented the service by letting people bid with their credits worth INR 50k for shirts each week? Within the app, if you of course like a shirt too much – you could always just pay the price after having tried it for 2 weeks.

The value within this model is derived not only from the refreshed fashion but also from a high quality maintenance that the brand will be able to provide. Surely, the clothe manufacturer will be able to lengthen the life of its clothes by taking proper care and eliminate your need to wash, dry and iron the shirts.



Some of you still might not concur with this deeper integration. But the best use case for this is present within the tyre industry. Michelin’s pay as you go model uses IoT to deliver higher efficiency per mile driven. The firm provides a service contract embedded with the tyres that enable better maintenance that translates to a long life.

This deep integration allowed trucking companies to lower their cost per mile of driving while providing Michelin a healthier bottomline by sales of services that were hitherto considered expensive and futile.



There are definitely more ways to augment the platform experience. Brands could offer newer fashions and experimental designs and run Kickstarter type campaigns to commercialize fashion design student ideas.

The firms will definitely benefit from lower storefront costs and little to no spoilage.

Whatever we may move ahead with as an added service, the core benefit is here to stay. Within the clothing industry, it’s time to Pay as you Slay!
