Marketing and advertising have never been the same since. From advertisements made of poorly convincing scientific facts to marketing campaigns that are alive in the streets, we have indeed come a long way. One such marketing strategy that is the rage today is Guerrilla Marketing.

Guerrilla Marketing is all about using unconventional techniques to achieve conventional goals. The word guerrilla here was inspired by guerrilla warfare which is a type of warfare that uses a combination of surprise elements, small & agile teams and efficient arms. Just like the guerrilla warfare, in guerrilla marketing, we can see a lot of similarities like ambushes, raids and surprises.
According to Wikipedia, Guerrilla marketing is an advertisement strategy to promote products or services on the streets or other public places with very little or no money. Since this involves very less money this can be an opportunity for small firms to take on big companies using only creativity, time and energy.
One such famous example is of a horror film produced by students of the University of Central Florida Film Program. The movie, The Blair Witch Project, was shot on a very small budget but it was its marketing technique that turned the sides. The team spread rumours about a fictional character ‘The Blair Witch’. They did this by creating a website to support the existence of the Blair Witch. The used a clickbait type tagline to catch the crowd. ‘In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary. A year later, their footage was found.’
Soon it became widely popular and also aired on television networks like Bravo. It started getting fans even before it was launched. The creators of the film not only got accepted into crème de la crème of the film schools but also ‘The Blair Witch Project’ grossed $248,639,099 worldwide.
Larger companies have also used similar techniques for their marketing campaigns, using hidden cameras and surprise elements. Coco-Cola has been quite successful in this. Their ‘Happiness Project’ involved a vending machine that delivered more than just cold beverages. They recorded crowd responses to make an advertisement out of it. Spreading moral values and happiness they slowly tried to connect the dots back to sharing a coke. It was advertisements like these that has slowly made marketing more than just explicitly claiming to be the best. The very basis of lifestyle marketing is to slowly convince our subconscious to relate activities to brands.
Redbull created one such image of extreme sports. Bringing together a sugary carbonated drink and life-risking leaps of faith. On 14th October 2012, Red Bull and Austrian extreme athlete Felix Baumgartner set a world record for the highest skydiving jump. With a staggering free fall of 4 minutes, the world stood on its feet to watch it, breaking social media records when they reached over 8 million confirmed concurrent views on YouTube.
These are just some cases where someone smart got his/her products selling without putting a hole in his/her pockets. But today we all know that everybody wants to duck an ad. We all eagerly wait for the skip ad button. Since the days of big billboards and cliché ads are long gone its time that everyone gets on the new boat and starts sailing with the wind.
Good Luck Selling!
