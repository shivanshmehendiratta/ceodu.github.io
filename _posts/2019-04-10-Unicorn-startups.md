 As of January 2019, there are more than 300 Unicorns around the world with the United States alone being home to more than 100 of them. A Unicorn company or Unicorn start-up is a private company with a valuation of over $1 billion.

But where do these Unicorns come from? Stanford alone boasts of 51 Unicorn founders among its Alumni. Also, to put in other words, according to this every 10th Unicorn that one comes across will have at least one Stanford graduate. But this solid record doesn’t come as a surprise given the proximity of Stanford with the world-famous start-up ecosystem of Silicon Valley coupled with the strong reputation of the institution. 

Before you jump to conclusions, do ask yourself a simple question. Are these Unicorns worth it? Or is it just a bubble ready to burst with Silicon Valley at its center? Since the financial crisis of 2008, interest rates have fallen close to zero in the States and has forced investors with idle cash to find alternatives to investing and the stock market seems the best place to take the bet. This excess of funds forces investment into the more marginal opportunities and this same investment pushes up the valuations in expectation of hitting another Facebook, Google or Amazon lottery. Also, the trend of acquiring companies by giants at inflated prices has accelerated the optimism associated with these start-ups. The practice of giving back the money to shareholders is long gone, the cash is used on acquisition which is partly intended to ensure competitors technology do not reach a dangerous size. Alphabet alone acquired 233 companies in its lifetime. Similarly, in the pursuit of jackpot, Microsoft has spent more than $60 billion on acquisitions including that of LinkedIn at $26.2 billion and Nokia at $ 7.2 billion.

After all, it all comes down to the fair valuation of the start-ups. Why is this valuation is skewed? Start-up valuation is a challenge as most of the start-ups are unprofitable but fast-growing and almost all have complex financial structures. There are multiple rounds of funding with investors involving different deals in terms of restrictions, privileges, and protection that are there in the contract. This complex structure with different classes of shares leads to the valuation of the company shares based on the last round. Finding fair value becomes intrinsic as some Unicorns have made such generous promises to their preferred shareholders that their common shares are nearly worthless. SpaceX, for example, raised funding in 2008 which had promised twice as money back and that too first in line if the company was to be liquidated. Investors sank in money which raised its valuation to new heights.

In such turbulent time, should one ride the bubble to prosperity, or should one be cautious enough to not be prey to another financial crisis? The choice is yours to make. As for now, Unicorns are a reality and are booming, this no one can deny.
