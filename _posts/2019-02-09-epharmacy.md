E-pharma retail industry is expected to grow at an exponential rate in the next 5 years on  account of rising health expenditure, increasing sensitivity over health issues, diversified product portfolios, escalating role of the government in healthcare expenditure and most importantly because of the robust expansion plans of chained pharma retail giants which have been ruling the industry since decades. The influx of private label brands is expected to raise the bars! There are crores of FDI flowing into this space and many big companies are entering into it.

The idea here is to develop integrated-online platforms that can solve the inadequacies of the existing healthcare delivery system through technology. These companies have a comprehensive business model that makes healthcare easily available, affordable and accessible to all. They tie-up with a number of diagnostic centres across metropolitan cities to provide services to their customers. Not only this, they offer deep discounts on drug purchases (nearly 20%) and on diagnostic tests (nearly 40%).

These businesses allow order tracking, ensure the delivery of medicines from the nearest store within 16- 18 hours on order placement, provide important drug information and recent buying trends through its huge database, appoint its own support staff to clear every doubt on the medicine prescription and provide the best out of every purchase!

Upcoming platforms like ‘EMedStore’ allow anyone to start their online pharmacy or increase the reach of their Brick and Mortar business to the millions in need, all around the globe. It allows the customers to create their own pharmacy brand and grow their business instantly through automation of the marketing and sales activities.

Indians can’t legally purchase medicines online anymore!

These e-pharmacies have been facing a lot of criticism on the online sale of drugs as they are operating in a grey regulatory zone that casts a cloud over the legality of their business model. They are considered as illegal by many along with a threat to 8 lac plus chemists, currently present in their area of operation. Delhi high court has ordered a complete ban on the online pharmacies across the country with an immediate effect!

The traditional pharmacists’ and government’s contention has been that if such websites are not regulated, then fake, contaminated and unapproved drugs may find their way into the consumers’ hands. Although the central government has taken the lead in changing regulations, even in the face of heavy opposition from traditional pharmacists, the constant flip-flop in the industry in the past two years has been rising.

However, petition is mainly against the government, not targeting the e-pharmacies. Petitioner advocates that the entire channel through which these e-pharmacies procure drugs is unregulated and is in contravention of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940.There is no central body governing e-pharma businesses which poses a bottleneck for the smooth expansion of these e-retailers. This issue needs to be resolved soon.

Meanwhile, the start-ups should also be allotted an umbrella license which could allow them to operate pan-India. Currently, they have to bear a lot of expenditure for interstate-shipments which compels them to partner with various local stores. A complete shift to online mode is not profitable always as they end up losing 40-45% of their orders due to invalid prescription, which is not the case in the offline world.

To keep the things going, eminent e-pharmacy start-ups are exploring their niche into other segments like clinical accessories, ayurvedic products, cosmetics to stand out from the crowd. They are also aiming expansion into related businesses such as diagnostics, telemedicine or enabling the booking of health tests and appointments from the convenience of home or providing various nutritional, personal care and health care products but it is again a grey area since there is no specific law governing it.

To address the issue of credibility of service providers, government can aim at creating a common domain name for all the accredited pharmacies, similar to what was adopted by US government back in 1999 where the governing body required all the accredited pharmacies to use a ‘.pharmacy’ domain name.

Towards the end, I would like to state that faster delivery to patients at remote locations is still a big issue, there still exists a lot of ambiguity not only around the requirement of licenses to sell medicine online, uploading and verification of prescription but around the veracity of the entire business model itself! Meanwhile, I would recommend all my readers to keep the contacts of nearby chemists handy!
